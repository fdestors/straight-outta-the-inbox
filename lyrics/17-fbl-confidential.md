# FBL Confidential

## Lyrics

### Intro 
 
Yo… late at night… me dashboard quiet…  
Then a coded message drop in me inbox…  
Encrypted vibes… covert signals…  
 
Bruv… it be an FBL. Classified ting.

### Verse 1
Yo, feedback loops arrive like intel drops  
Encrypted headers tighter than MI6 ops  
Mandem complain, system forward da clue  
A report land sayin’ “Here’s who clicked on you.” (innit)  
Not names — just signals, a warning ping  
A sender’s early radar for a dangerous ting  
It tell you “Bruv, somebody ain’t vibin' wid your mail”  
A subtle nudge sayin’ “Fix your content detail.”  
Me scroll through da FBL like spy dossier  
Check source IPs — track patterns in play  
Complaint indicators show who ain’t impressed  
And dat truth hit harder than a bulletproof vest (respect)

### Chorus
FBL talkin’ quiet from da shadows of the net  
Whispers in me inbox sayin’ clues be set (booyakasha)  
Signals droppin’ coded like a lockpick key  
Showin’ where complaints hide secretly  
Intel in the headers, truth inside the trace  
Guidin’ every movement like a watchful face (respect)  
Eight bars of insight slidin’ through da mist  
FBL knowledge sharpenin’ me sendin’ twist

### Verse 2
Yo, FBL reports be da frontline guides  
A peek at da complaints dat your list provides  
It ain’t shame — it information you need  
To prune dead weight and refine your lead  
When a user click “spam,” dat signal relayed  
So you fix da message and improve your trade (innit)  
It show frequency issues, content outta tune  
Tell you when to chill and not send too soon  
Da patterns speak clear like a spy transmission  
Every FBL a chance for revision  
Me adjust me segments, sharpen me aim  
Reduce da friction — elevate me game (respect)

### Chorus
FBL talkin’ quiet from da shadows of the net  
Whispers in me inbox sayin’ clues be set (booyakasha)  
Signals droppin’ coded like a lockpick key  
Showin’ where complaints hide secretly  
Intel in the headers, truth inside the trace  
Guidin’ every movement like a watchful face (respect)  
Eight bars of insight slidin’ through da mist  
FBL knowledge sharpenin’ me sendin’ twist

### Bridge 
Yo… look deeper, fam…  
Da complaint ain’t da enemy…  
It da message inside…  
A riddle for da sender to solve…  
Unlock da code…  
And evolve…

### Verse 3
Yo, last mission of da night — me decryptin’ da trace  
Connectin’ every pattern wid a serious face  
Complaint clusters show where da issue hide  
A secret map leadin’ me to modify  
Me fix tone, fix cadence, fix time of send  
So da next operation got better blend (innit)  
FBL teach humble — and humble be strong  
A pro sender adapt when da signals go wrong  
Now me campaigns steady, me rep stay bright  
Cuz me study da whispers dat arrive at night (respect)  
Ali G(mail) — intelligence refined  
Da secret agent of deliverer mind (booyakasha)

### Final Chorus 
FBL confidential — coded in da night  
Whispers from da inbox keep me sendin’ right  
FBL confidential — data never lie  
Guidin' me campaign like a watchful eye (respect)  
FBL confidential — truth in every line  
Ali G(mail) decode, adjust, refine  
FBL confidential — pure insight art  
Deliverer wisdom for a sender’s heart

### Outro
Mission complete…  
Intel secured…  
Sender leveled up…
