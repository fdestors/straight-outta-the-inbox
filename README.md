# Straight Outta The Inbox 📧

Booyakasha!

**Straight Outta the Inbox** is (as far as me lawyers can tell) the world’s first full-length rap concept album about email deliverability. Respect.

Dis album tell da true story of what happen when a sender try to rise up from da junk folder and make it big in da inbox. Along da way, man gotta face bare enemies: spam filters, blocklists, bounces, complaints, dodgy lists, authentication tingz, and dem mysterious inbox gods at Outlook, Yahoo, and Gmail who never answer no tickets.

It’s jokes.
It’s rap.

Every acronym, every error code, every technical pain mentioned in da lyrics is a real thing that can mess up your sends in real life. Dis ain’t fantasy — dis is infrastructure.

### What is dis repo, yeah?

Dis GitHub repo host da **official lyrics**, written in clean Markdown so:

* you can read dem proper,
* diff dem like a serious developer,
* version-control da bars,
* or fork da ting and add footnotes if you’s a massive nerd (respect).

### Why Ali G make dis?

Because deliverability is always explained in boring PDFs and scary dashboards.
So Ali G said: *“What if man explain it with beats, punchlines and emotional damage instead?”*

If you ever:

* got slapped by a sudden spike in bounces,
* been judged by a spam filter you can’t see,
* or tried explain SPF, DKIM and DMARC without losin’ da room…

Dis album is for you, bruv.

### What dis repo is *not*

* It is not documentation (but it do document bare trauma)
* It is not a tutorial (but you will learn stuff accidentally)
* It is not marketing (Ali G don’t do funnels)

It is **culture**,
with logs, rejections, and bars.

Respect. ✌️
