# Greylisted Blues

## Lyrics

### Intro   
Mmhh… woke up dis mornin’… checked me send logs…  
Server whisper in me ear like “Try again later, fam…”  
And me got da Greylisted Blues… (innit)

### Verse 1  
Yo, me try send a message, simple hello vibe  
But da server reply like a passive-aggressive tribe  
“Temporary fail… come back in a bit…”  
Bruv, why you treat me headers like counterfeit?  
Me mail ain’t spam — me align and clean  
But da greylist demon lurkin’ behind da scene  
It block me first try, second try, even third  
Leavin’ Ali G(mail) feelin’ absurd  
Me domain legit like a monk in peace  
But da MTA talk back like “Hold up, cease…”  
Nothin’ personal — dat da system rule  
Still feel like detention outside of school (RESPEK)

### Chorus  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me waitin’ all day  
Mailbox say “Later, bruv,” pushin’ me away  
Got da Greylisted Blues — delay in me way  
Server playin’ hard-to-get like a shy DJ (booyakasha)  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me patience decay  
But eventually dey let me through anyway  
Got da Greylisted Blues — ain’t nothin’ to do  
Just retry, retry… like déjà vu

### Verse 2  
Yo, greylisting be simple — dat’s what dey say  
“Block da first attempt, check persistence, okay.”  
If you real, you retry — dat prove your worth  
But bruv, da wait time feel like givin’ birth  
Me MTA hustle, knock at da gate  
Server peekin’ out like “Nah bruv, wait.”  
Me logs full of “4xx temporary fail”  
Like some bureaucrat rejectin’ mail  
But deep down me know it ain't malicious hate  
It da system protectin’ from a spammer’s fate (innit)  
Still me stuck here hummin’ da email blues  
Greylisted again — nothin’ left to lose

### Chorus  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me waitin’ all day  
Mailbox say “Later, bruv,” pushin’ me away  
Got da Greylisted Blues — delay in me way  
Server playin’ hard-to-get like a shy DJ (RESPEK)  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me patience decay  
But eventually dey let me through anyway  
Got da Greylisted Blues — ain’t nothin’ to do  
Just retry, retry… like déjà vu

### Bridge  
 
Yo… it like bein’ outside a club…  
Security lookin’ you up and down like  
“Hmm… maybe you get in… but not now, fam…”  
 
Grey… list… life…

### Verse 3  
Yo, eventually da server soften its stance  
Let me message drip through like a hesitant dance  
Cuz dat persistence matter — dat retry spark  
Provin’ me sender ain’t fakin’ in da dark  
Soon as da gate open, me mail fly right  
Inbox glowin’ like celestial light  
But me never forget da cold, cold hold  
Da greylist story dat remain untold (innit)  
In da deliverer world you gotta accept  
Some ting be slow — but dat protocol kept  
Now me sing this tune wid me old-school shoes  
Ali G(mail) givin’ you da Greylisted Blues (booyakasha)

### Final Chorus  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me waitin’ all day  
Mailbox say “Later, bruv,” pushin’ me away  
Got da Greylisted Blues — delay in me way  
Server playin’ hard-to-get like a shy DJ (RESPEK)  
Got da Greylisted Blues — me patience decay  
But eventually dey let me through anyway  
Got da Greylisted Blues — truth in me view  
Retry, retry… dat how senders push through

### Outro  
If at first you don’t succeed…  
Retry… retry… retry again…  
Greylist life… 
Ali G(mail) out.
