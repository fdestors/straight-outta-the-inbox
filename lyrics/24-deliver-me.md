# Deliver Me

## Lyrics

### Intro 
In da silence before dawn…  
Me look back on every bounce, every struggle, every send…  
And me rise… stronger… ready…  
Deliver me… into da light. 

### Verse 1 
Yo… me walked through spamtraps, storms, and trials,  
Carried da weight of da inbox for miles,  
Held me domain through da darkest night,  
Till alignment shine and me future bright.  
From broken metrics to redemption rise,  
Me learn deliverability wid wiser eyes.  
And now… wid da choir behind me call…  
Ali G(mail) stand redeemed, stand tall. (respect)

### Pre-Chorus 
Lift me… guide me…  Through every filter, every sea…  
Hold me… shape me… Till me mail fly free…

### Chorus
Deliver me into da inbox sky,  
Let da sender spirit rise and amplify.  
Deliver me through da storm and strain,  
Till da message land clean like a blessed rain.  
Deliver me from da doubt and fear,  
Let me reputation ring loud and clear.  
Deliver me to da highest degree—  
Ali G(mail)… finally free.

### Verse 2 
Yo… me owe me strength to da mandem beside,  
Da giants who teach me how to send wid pride.  
All da tools, da wisdom, da guardians who care,  
Da fighters of spam who keep da pathways fair.  
Together we rise like a unified storm,  
Holdin’ da standard, protectin’ da form.  
Now da choir swell like a tidal sea,  
Liftin’ me spirit into destiny. (innit)
