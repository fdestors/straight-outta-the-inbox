## Lyrics

### Intro  
Close your eyes, fam…  
Breathe in… breathe out…  
Imagine your sender reputation… rising like steam off a kebab…  
Feel da positivity… da alignment… da authentication…  
And now… open your eyes…  
You ready to boost your RPM, bruv? (booyakasha)

### Verse 1 
Yo, RPM be me metric of pride  
Reputation Per Minute — how me domain glide  
Every send me make add a lil' shine  
Like polish on me chain — dat sender divine  
Good vibes stack up like coins in a game  
One minute I’m calm, next minute insane  
Me engagement grow steady wid a proper routine  
Warm-up locked, content clean, list hygiene  
Filters see me moves and dey whisper “He stable”  
Not like dem risky senders flippin’ tables  
RPM rise when you flow legit  
No dodgy blasts, no desperate script (innit)  
Ali G(mail) got rhythm in da deliverer’s lane  
RPM pumpin’ through me sender’s vein

### Chorus 
RPM — reputation rise again  
Steady as a king wid a golden pen  
RPM — every minute me ascend  
Ali G(mail) set trends — no pretend (RESPEK)  
RPM — keep it smooth, no spam  
Craft each line like da lyrical exam  
RPM — dat’s da measure I slam  
Legend in da inbox — thank you fam (booyakasha)

### Verse 2 
Yo, me keep me rep tight like a new pair of creps  
Every send me do, me double-check steps  
No broken links, no trickery ting  
No shady footers tryna hide da sting  
Me align me headers proper — SPF right  
DKIM shining like me teeth at night  
Da more consistent me pattern, da higher me score  
RPM rise like a lift from the ground floor  
Open rates jump like rabbits on a mission  
Me click-through buzz like prime-time television  
Good vibes feed da system, it reward me flow  
Cuz inboxes love authenticity glow (innit)  
Reputation stackin’ minute by minute  
Ali G(mail) in da booth — pure spirit within it

### Chorus 
RPM — reputation rise again  
Steady as a king wid a golden pen  
RPM — every minute me ascend  
Ali G(mail) set trends — no pretend  
RPM — keep it smooth, no spam  
Craft each line like da lyrical exam  
RPM — dat’s da measure I slam  
Legend in da inbox — thank you fam (RESPEK)

### Bridge
Yo… breathe wid me…  
Now picture your domain reputation doin’ little push-ups…  
One reputation… two reputation…  
Growin’ buff like a bodybuilder wid good engagement… (booyakasha)

### Verse 3 
Yo, RPM be da compass in me digital sea  
When it rise, me deliverability free  
When it drop, me evaluate what wrong  
Fix me cadence, adjust me song  
I watch me complaints like a hawk on guard  
One tiny spike can hit you hard  
But me handle feedback wid classy grace  
A gentleman sender wid a yellow face  
I prune me list, me build me trust  
I send wid honesty — dat’s a must  
RPM thrive when you earn respect  
Not playin’ games or tryna deflect  
Me rep climb high like a drone in breeze  
Filters smile soft like “Ali, proceed.” (innit)  
RPM be me force, me invisible crown  
Ali G(mail) wear it proud — hold it down

### Final Chorus 
RPM — reputation rise again  
Steady as a king wid a golden pen  
RPM — every minute me ascend  
Ali G(mail) set trends — no pretend (RESPEK)  
RPM — keep it smooth, no spam  
Craft each line like da lyrical exam  
RPM — da metric I jam  
Deliverer royalty — that’s who I am (booyakasha)

### Outro  
And now, fam…  
Slowly return to your normal sendin’ state…  
Keep ya reputation strong…  
Keep ya mind aligned…  
Ali G(mail)… bless up.
