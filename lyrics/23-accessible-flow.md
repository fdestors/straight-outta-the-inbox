Let da screen readers follow every episode (respect)

Every line you build gotta flow accessibly (booyakasha)  
Clear communication be a universal vibe

Every human journey need a path that align (respect)  
Put love in your layout, clarity in your key  
And watch your send transform to pure harmony

Don’t crush your paragraphs till dey flat like death  
Big touch targets for da thumbs in motion  
Give your design balance like waves in the ocean (innit)

A sender’s humanity shown in every way (respect)
