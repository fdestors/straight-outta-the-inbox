# Spam Filter Nemesis

## Lyrics

### Verse 1
Yo, me fightin’ spam filters like dey mortal enemies, fam  
Dey see me subject line and hit da button like *BAM*  
Dey scan every word like detectives sniffin’ glue  
Lookin’ for “FREE!!!” or “WIN!!!” like me some scam crew  
But me legit sender — me honourable lad  
Yet da filter treat me dirty like homework gone bad  
It judge me colors, me fonts, me layout choice  
It even hate me GIFs — bruv, dat’s anti-joy voice  
Yo, one time Gmail block me just cuz me used “yo”  
Dat profiling, innit? Dat’s discrimination flow  
Inbox Senders Club chant “Ali, don’t give in!”  
So me polish me headers and prepare to win  
Spam filter sneer at me vibe, but me rise like dawn  
Dis war epic like a fantasy novel drawn (RESPEK)

### Chorus
Spam filter nemesis — me eternal foe  
Every time me send a message, it whisper “no”  
But I fight back strong wid me inbox flow  
Ali G(mail) on attack — ready to blow (booyakasha)  
Spam filter nemesis — da algorithm king  
Try analyse me soul like creepy forensic ting  
But me lyrics too slick for da blocklist ring  
Deliverability warrior — hear me sing (innit)

### Verse 2
Oi, spam filter be dramatic like a soap opera queen  
“Your email too spicy!” — bruv, me barely said a ting  
It check me URLs like me smuggling contraband  
Just cuz me linking to me blog — dat’s a harmless brand  
It think every sender guilty ‘til proven clean  
Like Judge Judy if she worked on a mail machine  
One day Outlook whisper “Ali, your ratio low”  
I be like “Ratio? Bruv, dis ain’t TikTok show!”  
Me fix me tone, me tighten me flow  
Segment me list so da filter mellow  
Move wid finesse like ninja in haze  
Me headers aligned in mysterious ways  
Inbox Senders Club cheer when me lines pass through  
Dem filters confused like “Wait… he’s *legit*? True?” (innit)

### Chorus
Spam filter nemesis — me eternal foe  
Every time me send a message, it whisper “no”  
But I fight back strong wid me inbox flow  
Ali G(mail) on attack — ready to blow  
Spam filter nemesis — da algorithm king  
Try analyse me soul like creepy forensic ting  
But me lyrics too slick for da blocklist ring  
Deliverability warrior — hear me sing (RESPEK)

### Bridge
Me see you…  
Hiding behind da algorithm wall…  
But guess what, spam filter — you can’t escape lyrical justice…  
Not when Ali G(mail) sharpen his bars… (booyakasha)

### Verse 3
Yo, spam filter treat me like me cursed or hexed  
Flaggin’ me harder than me Nan readin’ suspicious texts  
It scan me sender rep like a stalker wid no chill  
“Engagement too low? Bounce rate high? Kill.”  
But me domain fight back — me warm it day by day  
Me patience deeper than a buffet entrée  
I fix me cadence, refine me craft  
Remove dodgy lines, polish every draft  
And when da day come, me inbox light shine  
Like “Ali, you passed!” — dat moment divine  
Spam filter finally bow, defeated in awe  
Cuz me deliverability kung-fu too raw  
Inbox Senders Club roar wid unholy delight  
Ali G(mail) conquer da filter — eternal rite (innit)

### Final Chorus 
Spam filter nemesis — me eternal foe  
Every time me send a message, it whisper “no”  
But I fight back strong wid me inbox flow  
Ali G(mail) victorious — ready to glow (RESPEK)  
Spam filter nemesis — da algorithm king  
Try analyse me soul like creepy forensic ting  
But me bars too mighty — let da victory ring  
Deliverability legend — Ali G sing (booyakasha)

### Outro  
And so… once again…  
Da spam filter fall before me lyrical might…  
Tune in next time for our next episode of…  
“ALI G(MAIL) vs DA ALGORITHMIC OPPRESSORS!”
