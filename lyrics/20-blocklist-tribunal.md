# Blocklist Tribunal


## Lyrics

### Intro 
[Tribunal Calling to Order]  
Oyé! Oyé! The Inbox Protection Court is now in session!  
Case of: The People and Spamhaus versus Ali G(mail).  
Accusation: “Sending spam on a massive scale.”  

Alig G: Bruv… me barely sendin’ memes…

### Verse 1  
Yo, judge stare down wid a stone-cold face  
“Ali G, you accused of makin’ inbox a disgrace.”  
Me shocked — “Spam? Me? Dat ain’t me scene!  
Me emails cleaner than organic cuisine.”  
Prosecutor slam graphs like dramatic TV  
Showin’ spikes in signups — lookin’ suspicious to me  
Bounce rate chaotic, engagement bizarre  
Logs lookin’ like someone nuked me PR  
But me swear on me tracksuit, me innocent lad  
Me send slow and proper — nothin’ wild or bad  
Still the courtroom tense like a thriller screen  
Accusers think Ali wildin’ behind the machine (innit)

### Chorus  
The Blocklist tribunal — tension high  
Me reputation hangin’ by a digital tie  
The Blocklist tribunal — what could it be?  
Accused of spamming — but dat ain’t me (RESPEK)  
The Blocklist tribunal — truth must shine  
Find da cause, clear me name, realign  
The Blocklist tribunal — verdict soon  
Will Ali G(mail) walk free or face doom? (booyakasha)

### Verse 2 
Yo, prosecutor shout “Da evidence strong!  
Fifty thousand signups — in two minutes long!”  
Judge gasp heavy like he swallowed a bee  
Me jump up: “Bruv, dat weren’t even me!”  
Spamhaus expert stroll in — calm and neat  
Wid charts and logs tidy like a spreadsheet  
He say, “Your honor, let’s slow this pace,  
The sender may be innocent in this case.”  
He point at me signup form on the screen  
Exposin’ dat ting like a crime scene clean  
“No CAPTCHA, no double opt in, no shield in place —  
Prime target for bots to flood the space.” (innit)

### Chorus  
The Blocklist tribunal — tension high  
Me reputation hangin’ by a digital tie  
The Blocklist tribunal — what could it be?  
Accused of spamming — but dat ain’t me  
The Blocklist tribunal — truth must shine  
Find da cause, clear me name, realign  
The Blocklist tribunal — verdict soon  
Will Ali G(mail) walk free or face doom? (respekt)

### Bridge
[spoken, Spamhaus Expert] “Your honor…  
[spoken, Spamhaus Expert]This wasn’t spam.  
[spoken, Spamhaus Expert]This was *subscription bombing* — a.k.a. list bombing.  
[spoken, Spamhaus Expert]Thousands of malicious signups submitted automatically  
[spoken, Spamhaus Expert]to frame the defendant and harm random victims.”  
Whaaaat?! Bruv, someone bombed me LIST?!  
Dat’s disrespect of the highest magnitude… (booyakasha)

### Verse 3  
Yo, courtroom murmur like bees in a hive  
Spamhaus explainin’ how da bots arrive  
Attackers submit emails at ludicrous speed  
Try bury legit forms wid malicious greed  
Judge nod slow, like ancient oak  
Understanding growin’ wid every word spoke  
Defense show screenshots — signup logs burst  
Names like “x9fh-q99” — bruv, dat ain’t rehearsed  
Me realize me form wide open like a shop  
No protection to slow da robot hop  
“Ali,” expert say, “you not da cause —  
Just upgrade security and respect da laws.” (innit)

### Final Chorus  
The Blocklist tribunal — truth revealed  
Accusations dropped, reputation healed (respekt)  
The Blocklist tribunal — me stand tall  
Victim of a bomb, not guilty at all  
The Blocklist tribunal — justice done  
From chaos to clarity — case won  
The Blocklist tribunal — judge decree  
Ali G(mail)… innocent, officially! (booyakasha)

### Outro  
Me goin’ home to install CAPTCHA, Confirmed Opt In, da whole ting…  
Ain’t no robot army violatin’ me forms again…  
Tribunal adjourned… tracksuit approved… Ali G(mail) out.
