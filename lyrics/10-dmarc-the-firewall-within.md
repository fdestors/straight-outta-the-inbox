# DMARC: The Firewall Within

## Lyrics

### Intro 
They tried to send as me…  
They tried to wear me name like a mask…  
But this time, Ali G(mail) ain’t playin’. (booyakasha)

### Verse 1 
Yo, DMARC be da line dat divide da fakes  
From da real senders climbin’ up reputation stakes  
Spoofers try craft me identity like stolen art  
But DMARC snap back — tear impostors apart  
SPF align solid, DKIM be da spine  
Two signatures guardin’ every lyrical line  
And when dey connect, dat triple-check conspire  
To expose every geezer wid fraudulent fire (innit)  
Attackers send out from “me,” but dat ain’t legit  
DMARC slap them like “Nah fam, authenticate it!”  
Me rua reports light up like distress flares  
Pointin’ to domains wid impersonation affairs  
Me stand in da storm wid a cold steel mind  
Determination sharpened, reputation refined (RESPEK)

### Chorus
This be DMARC — da firewall within  
A guardian spirit blockin’ every sin  
Domains in da dark try break in and spin  
But Ali G(mail) rise — protected from within (booyakasha)  
This be DMARC — da armor me wear  
When spoofers attack, me stand right dere  
A domain’s true voice must be clean and fair  
And dat truth shine loud in da deliverer air

### Verse 2 
Yo, me policy strict — reject be da stance  
No “maybe,” no “later,” no senders by chance  
Me domain a fortress wid a single gate  
Only let pass messages alignin’ straight  
Scammers lurk heavy wid malicious desire  
Try ignite chaos wid fraudulent fire  
But DMARC hold firm, never bend, never shake  
Detectin’ da patterns dat criminals make (innit)  
Me read every aggregate report like prophecy  
A list of liars who tried to copy me  
From random IPs to corrupted bots  
Tryna spoof me name like amateur plots  
But dis protocol sacred — me shield of truth  
A beacon for every deliverer youth (RESPEK)

### Chorus 
This be DMARC — da firewall within  
A guardian spirit blockin’ every sin  
Domains in da dark try break in and spin  
But Ali G(mail) rise — protected from within  
This be DMARC — da armor me wear  
When spoofers attack, me stand right dere  
A domain’s true voice must be clean and fair  
And dat truth shine loud in da deliverer air (booyakasha)

### Bridge
 
Alignment be a warzone…  
 
One wrong header and your whole castle fall…  
But when DMARC stand tall…  
Everything align like destiny.

### Verse 3
Yo, in da battlefield of headers, me move like a ghost  
Check da “From” and “Return-Path,” every value precise  
One misaligned bit and your domain get roast  
Filters slam shut — reputation diced  
But me train wid da protocol, code in me brain  
Audit me signals again and again  
SPF say “verified,” DKIM say “signed”  
DMARC watch like a judge wid a digital mind (innit)  
When true alignment hit — BOOM — da gates open wide  
Inbox glow golden like a victory stride  
Spoofers run scared like cockroaches in light  
Real senders rise — authenticated right  
Me domain protected — da prophecy clear  
Ali G(mail) send fearless, without fear (RESPEK)

### Final Chorus 
This be DMARC — da firewall within  
A guardian spirit blockin’ every sin  
Domains in da dark try break in and spin  
But Ali G(mail) rise — protected from within (booyakasha)  
This be DMARC — da armor me wear  
When spoofers attack, me stand right dere  
A domain’s true voice must be clean and fair  
And dat justice echo everywhere

### Outro 
 
Identity be sacred…  
Spoofers be desperate…  
But DMARC be eternal…  
Ali G(mail)… aligned… out.
