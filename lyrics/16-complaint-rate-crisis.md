# Complaint Rate Crisis

## Lyrics

### Intro
 
Yo… somethin’ wrong wid me dashboard…  
Why da red light flashin’?  
Why da numbers climbin’?  
 
BRUV—SOMEBODY COMPLAININ’ ON ME?!

### Verse 1
Yo, me open me metrics — nearly faint, swear down  
Complaint rate risin’ like it tryna take da crown  
O dot 1… O dot 3… O dot 5…  
Bruv me heartbeat bouncin’ at a dangerous rate  
“DID DEY HATE ME CONTENT?!” — me yell at da screen  
“Was it da subject line? Was me CTA mean?”  
Me scrollin’ through logs like a man possessed  
Analyzin’ every click like a criminal confess  
Got me sweatin’ through me tracksuit, fear in me chest  
Reputation on da line — me can’t rest (innit)  
Me ask me email like “BRUV, WHAT DID YOU DO?!”  
Message whisper back like “Fam, IDK… ask da crew.”  
Complaint storm brewin’, it lookin’ insane  
Every minute pass — another domain strain (respect)

### Chorus
Complaint rate climbin’ quick, me heartbeat swingin’ wild  
Gmail compliance dashboard flashin’ red like “Calm down, child” (booyakasha)  
Me numbers breach point-three, that sacred threshold line  
Once you cross 0.3 percent, reputation decline  
Charts bleedin’ crimson now, panic crushin’ me chest  
Gmail warnings hittin’ hard like “Bruv, give it a rest” (respect)  
Me stuck in meltdown mode, mind spiralin’ too strong  
Gotta fix me sendin’ ways or everything go wrong

### Verse 2
Yo, me overreactin’, but da charts ain’t kind  
Complaint bar red like it tryna remind  
“Yo Ali, you sendin’ too much nonsense, bruv.”  
But me swear me content crafted wid love  
Still someone out dere smashed “This is spam!”  
Like me message committed an email exam  
Maybe me send too early… too late…  
Maybe da cadence off — destiny or fate  
Me chasing clues like Sherlock in code  
Cross-referencin’ timestamps, mode by mode  
Lookin’ for da cause like a deranged detective  
Me inbox vibe feelin’ introspective (innit)  
"Was it dat GIF? Too spicy a vibe?"  
Or some angry bloke from a rival tribe?  
No context given — just a click of hate  
And now me whole domain at stake (repect)

### Chorus

Complaint rate climbin’ quick, me heartbeat swingin’ wild  
Gmail compliance dashboard flashin’ red like “Calm down, child” (booyakasha)  
Me numbers breach point-three, that sacred threshold line  
Once you cross 0.3 percent, reputation decline  
Charts bleedin’ crimson now, panic crushin’ me chest  
Gmail warnings hittin’ hard like “Bruv, give it a rest” (respect)  
Me stuck in meltdown mode, mind spiralin’ too strong  
Gotta fix me sendin’ ways or everything go wrong

### Bridge

Yo… maybe… maybe it ain’t about me…  
Maybe dey unsubbin’ cuz life change…  
Maybe da content weren’t right for ‘em…  
Maybe it normal… maybe—

 
Nah fam… calm down… breathe…  
Complaint rate be a signal…  
Not a betrayal…  
(respect)

### Verse 3
Yo, me realize fast — complaint rate truth  
A feedback loop deeper than me reckless youth  
People complain when dey ain’t find value  
Or confused by da message dat randomly found you  
It not malice — it clarity for senders to learn  
A spotlight on me vibe, where me improve in turn  
So me refine me list, clean da dead weight  
Cut da disinterested — check me send rate  
Improve me segments, sharpen me style  
Test me copy wid deliverer smile (innit)  
Complaint rate drop like a healing tide  
Me domain breathin’ easy from da inside  
Me no longer panic — me metrics align  
Ali G(mail) walk da deliverer line (booyakasha)

### Final Chorus
Me out da crisis now — heartbeat slow and clean,  
Dashboard cool again — no red left on da screen (respect)  
Complaint rate fallin’ — storm fade from sight,  
Me sharpened me craft and me sendin’ it right  
Domain back steady — da chaos be gone,  
No more spirals draggin’ me mental along  
And da truth hit deep — me final express:  
Respect your audience… dat’s how you progress (booyakasha)

### Outro
 
Yo… me nearly lost it, fam…  
But now me wiser…  
Ali G(mail)… 
complaint-rate survivor…
