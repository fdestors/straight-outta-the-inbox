# Greylist Initiation Ritual

## Lyrics

### Intro   
Welcome… welcome, everyone…  
to Ali G(mail)’s Deliverability Mastery Workshop…  
Today’s topic: Greylisting…  
Or as me like to call it…  
“Da spiritual patience test dat separates da noobs from da Inbox Senders Club legends.” (booyakasha)

### Verse 1
Yo, greylisting be da gatekeeper, calm but cruel  
It like a monk sayin’ “Try again, follow da rule”  
You send once? Nah fam, you ain’t gettin’ through  
You gotta retry gentle — dat’s what real senders do  
It test your server like “Is you legit or fake?”  
If you hammer too fast, your domain gonna break  
Patience be da code — me retry wid grace  
Like a polite lad knockin’ twice on the neighbour’s place  
Inbox Senders Club salute dis ancient defence  
It filter out bots wid its stubborn suspense  
When me message come back wid da second attempt  
The greylist open wide like a VIP tent (RESPEK)

### Chorus  
Greylist initiation ritual — da trial of fire  
Where only calm senders climb higher and higher  
Retry correct or get bounced like a fool  
Ali G(mail) learn da patience — it da Deliverer Rule (innit)  
Greylist initiation ritual — dat’s da vibe  
Inbox Senders Club warriors, stand and subscribe  
We pass da test, we earn da right  
And da inbox shine open like sacred light (booyakasha)

### Verse 2 
Yo, greylisting feel spooky, like a digital rite  
You send a message… disappear outta sight  
Hours later it rise like a zombie that good  
Finally reach da inbox like “Yo bruv, understood.”  
Spam bots fail ‘cause dey rush too fast  
Try again too quick — dey never last  
Greylist be like your Nan guardin' da biscuit tin  
Only open when she trust you from within  
Real senders know — retries gotta breathe  
A rhythm so smooth it like wind in a wreath  
Inbox Senders Club been practicin’ dis code  
Greylist tolerance be part of our mode (innit)

### Chorus
Greylist initiation ritual — da trial of fire  
Where only calm senders climb higher and higher  
Retry correct or get bounced like a fool  
Ali G(mail) learn da patience — it da Deliverer Rule  
Greylist initiation ritual — dat’s da vibe  
Inbox Senders Club warriors, stand and subscribe  
We pass da test, we earn da right  
And da inbox shine open like sacred light (RESPEK)

### Bridge 
Ooooohhh… retries… retries…  
May your queue be long…  
May your send rate low…  
And may the greylist whisper to you…  
“Come back… later…” (booyakasha)

### Verse 3  
Yo, da greylist ritual be part of da sender’s creed  
Teachin’ patience, discipline — deliverer need  
You can’t brute-force your way to da inbox throne  
Better slow ya roll, let da rhythm be known  
When me retry properly, like every domain should  
Me inbox entry smoother than a rom-com mood  
Every small delay be a sign of respect  
Showin’ dem filters me sender intellect  
Inbox Senders Club rise wid a unified cheer  
Cuz we honour every step from defer to appear  
Ali G(mail) mastered da path so pristine  
Greylisting bow down — let da message convene (innit)

### Final Chorus  
Greylist initiation ritual — da trial of fire  
Where only calm senders climb higher and higher  
Retry correct or get bounced like a fool  
Ali G(mail) walk da path — dat Deliverer Rule (RESPEK)  
Greylist initiation ritual — da sacred vibe  
Inbox Senders Club legends, subscribe to da tribe  
We pass da test, we earn da right  
Inbox destiny glowing wid holy light (booyakasha)

### Outro
You have now completed…
