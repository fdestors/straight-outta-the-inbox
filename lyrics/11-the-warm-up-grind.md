# The Warm-Up Grind


## Lyrics

### Intro
Mic check… mic check… one-two, one-two…  
See dat? Even me voice need warmin’ up before droppin’ bars…  
Same thing wid domains, fam — you don’t go full blast cold…  
You start gentle… then rise… then boom — inbox warfare.

### Verse 1 
Yo, me start small — twenty sends on day one  
Like a budget firework sparkin’ but not fully begun  
Me ain’t rushin’, nah fam, dat suicide ting  
You blast too heavy, your domain lose its bling  
Me keepin’ it steady like joggin’ in me Timberland shoes  
Each day double up, choosin’ wisely who me choose  
Filters peekin’ like “Who’s dat?” — me playin’ it slow  
Buildin’ trust wid every send — dat’s how deliverers grow  
If you rush dis warm-up, domain go stiff  
Like tryin’ to bench-press 200 widout a lift  
Nah, me rise careful — reputation to gain  
Warm it like leftovers in da microwave lane (innit)

### Chorus 
The warm-up grind — slow climb to da sky  
Build trust proper before you amplify  
No shortcuts, bruv — dat path decline  
Success take patience — warm-up grind (RESPEK)  
The warm-up grind — maintain ya line  
Day by day, let da sender rep shine  
If you rush in cold, the filters confine  
So we rise steady — warm-up grind (booyakasha)

### Verse 2 
Yo, me ain’t one of dem geezer who blast day one  
Outlook see dat and say “Nah fam, you done.”  
Me treat me domain like a baby bird in a nest  
Feed it slow, gentle — dat’s deliverability best  
Dem algorithms sniff vibes like digital police  
Lookin’ for signs of sketchiness to cease  
But when me send small, dey relax in peace  
Like “aight, Ali G(mail), you may release.”  
Warm-up schedule tighter than a personal trainer  
Day by day me domain become container  
Of respect, trust, and engagement true  
Watchin’ me rep climb like mountain view  
Bounce rates drop, opens rise  
Filters watch me like “Bruv, he wise.” (innit)

### Chorus 
The warm-up grind — slow climb to da sky  
Build trust proper before you amplify  
No shortcuts, bruv — dat path decline  
Success take patience — warm-up grind  
The warm-up grind — maintain ya line  
Day by day, let da sender rep shine  
If you rush in cold, the filters confine  
So we rise steady — warm-up grind (RESPEK)

### Bridge 
Yo… warmin’ up your domain be like warmin’ up pizza…  
You can’t shove it in raw an’ expect miracles…  
Give it a lil’ heat, a lil’ love, and BOOM… inbox flavour. (booyakasha)

### Verse 3 
Yo, each day of warm-up be a step in da quest  
Tryna reach dat inbox throne — da deliverer’s crest  
I monitor me volumes like a hawk on a wire  
Adjustin’ each send like a DJ on fire  
Quality before quantity — dat’s da sender creed  
A warmed domain grow faster than a bamboo seed  
Soon me reputation shining like a chrome hubcap  
Filters recognize greatness — dey tip dere cap  
And when da warm-up done, me domain full grown  
Ali G(mail) proudly sittin’ on his deliverer throne  
Wid workflows smooth like a premium gin  
And a sender score higher than me ego’s grin (innit)

### Final Chorus 
The warm-up grind — slow climb to da sky  
Build trust proper before you amplify  
No shortcuts, bruv — dat path decline  
Success take patience — warm-up grind (RESPEK)  
The warm-up grind — maintain ya line  
Day by day, let da sender rep shine  
If you rush in cold, the filters confine  
So we rise steady — warm-up grind (booyakasha)

### Outro  
Warm slow… rise strong…  
Or get blasted by da filters like a fool…  
Choose wisely, fam…  
Ali G(mail)… out.
