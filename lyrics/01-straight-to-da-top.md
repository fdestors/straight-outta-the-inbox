# Straight To Da Top

## Lyrics

### Intro
Listen up, all you marketin' man dem!  
You's all worried about your "deliver-ability"... (Snickers)  
You's goin' to da spam folder! But I's cracked it.  
It's da Al-Gore-Rhythm... And it's basically just me name!  
Check it!

### Verse 1 
You got your SPF, your DKIM...  
(Confused) whatever dat is You's writin' "subject lines" but it's all a miss  
Your email goes to "Promotions" Or even worse, da bin!  
But when Ali sends an email It always gets in! (shouted)  
You is checkin' your "open rates"  
I is checkin' me new roller skates  
You talk about "da metrics". 
I's just talkin' to da fit chicks  

### Chorus 
ALI-GMAIL! It ain't no mystery! It's just my name, it's ALI-G! G-MAIL!  
I cracked da code, you see! I is da Al-Gore-Rhythm, literally!  
Dey call it "deliver-ability" I call it "gettin' in da box"  
I get 100 percent... every time... no stops!  

### Verse 2
Da Google geeks, dey try to stop me  
But dey can't block da original G  
Dey say "Ali, how you always in da Primary Tab?"  
I say "It's easy, just don't be a nob!"  
I don't need no "double opt-in"  
When dey see me name, dey just let me in  
I'm sendin' out me new mixtape  
Straight to da top, it's no mistake!  
It's well good.

### Chorus
ALI-GMAIL! It ain't no mystery! It's just my name, it's ALI-G! G-MAIL!  
I cracked da code, you see! I is da Al-Gore-Rhythm, literally!  
Dey call it "deliver-ability" I call it "gettin' in da box"  
I get 100 percent... every time... no stops!  

### Bridge
All you man wit your "A/B testin'"... Wot is dat?  
Is you testin' if you is "A"? Or if you is "B"?  
Just be G! It's simple.  
I just press 'send' and it goes straight to da top. Respek. 

### Outro
So if you want your email read...  
Just put "From: Ali G" instead. Trust me.  
It's da science. Aight.  
I'm out. Goin' for a Zinger burger.  
Keep it real.
