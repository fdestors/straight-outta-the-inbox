# Welcome to the Junk Folder

## Lyrics

### Intro
iz ya boy Ali G(mail), direct from da spam gutter massive… (innit)  
Big up to all me filtered warriors locked up in junk folders across da land…  
To Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo — allow me to pass thru once in a while, ya get me? (RESPEK)  
Now listen up… we goin’ deep, like me browser history when me forgot to clear it… (booyakasha)


Yeah… dey tried to bin me… dey tried to silence me…  
But you can’t silence da truth, fam…  
YOU CAN’T SILENCE ALI G(MAIL)! (innit)

### Verse 1
Yo, me iz born in da junk folder, raised among da spam crew  
Dey labelled me “phishy” just ‘cause me subject line said “Hey u”  
Filters treat me like a criminal, like me sellin’ dodgy pills  
But me lyrics be natural medicine — dem cure deliverability ills  
Every time me press “send,” dey like “nah fam, denied”  
So me ends up rotting next to “Hot Singles In Your Area” on da side  
Even Outlook be givin’ me that dirty side-eye glance  
Like “bruv, me ain’t trustin’ no rapper in yellow pants”  
But me rise from suppression lists like Jesus on a Monday  
Break free from da spam trap — new inbox entry runway  
Ali G(mail) don’t quit, me got determination like me Nan  
Try stop me sendin’? Bruv, you can’t, I got a 100-email plan (booyakasha)

### Chorus
Welcome to da junk folder — da place dey stick me in  
But me fightin’ for da inbox, me determined to win  
All me messages trapped, but me still goin’ bolder  
Stand tall, raise ya headers — welcome to da junk folder (innit)  
Welcome to da junk folder — no glory, just pain  
But me still spittin’ fire like SPF in a chain  
One day Gmail show respek and me rise like a soldier  
‘Til den, we locked in — welcome to da junk folder

### Verse 2
Yo, dem spam filters be judgin’ me like some posh magistrate  
Dey see me vibe, dey like “nah mate, dis one ain’t gonna rate”  
Me domain rep low, but me swagger high like Heathrow flights  
Tryna warm up me sendin’, but dey throttle out me nights  
Dey scan me text for naughty words like “FREE,” “CLICK,” “WIN”  
Bruv, dat ain’t spam — dat’s just what me say when me begin  
Dey check me attachments like me smuggling forbidden cheese  
All me wanted was to flex me mixtape with ease  
Dey say me too loud, too proud, too bold in me headers  
But Ali G(mail) ain’t foldin’ — me built for dese letters  
Dey want “best practices”? Fam, me invented dem things  
Me unsubscribe link smooth like me gold chains swings  
Dey can DMARC me, SPF me, DKIM test me soul  
But me still aim for inbox — dat’s me lifelong goal (RESPEK)

### Chorus 
Welcome to da junk folder — da place dey stick me in  
But me fightin’ for da inbox, me determined to win  
All me messages trapped, but me still goin’ bolder  
Stand tall, raise ya headers — welcome to da junk folder (innit)  
Welcome to da junk folder — dey keep holdin’ me down  
But me spirit too strong, bruv, can’t silence da crown  
One day Outlook show respek when me spit like a soldier  
‘Til den, we hold tight — welcome to da junk folder

### Bridge
Yo Gmail… why you hatin’ me cuz?  
Me SPF aligned… me DKIM shiny… me DMARC on fleek…  
Yet you still treat me like some wasteman newsletter from 2003… (bruv)  
Allow me na… me just wanna spread lyrical edutainment… (innit)

### Verse 3
Yo, me climb outta da junk bin like some majestic phoenix  
Me bars so sick dey make even spam filters get motion sickness  
Ali G(mail) destined for da inbox spotlight glow  
Dem algorithms ain’t ready for da lyrical flow  
Me bounce back like soft bounces on a Sunday night  
Retry me send and suddenly everything right  
Cuz persistence be power, and respek be da key  
Every inbox me conquer brings new glory to me  
So to all me messages rottin’ with da moldy promotions  
Hold tight, stay strong, we navigatin’ these oceans  
Junk folder a prison, but Ali G(mail) da warden  
Soon we rise up together — inbox freedom is certain (booyakasha)

### Final Chorus
Welcome to da junk folder — da place dey hide da best  
But me pushin’ through da filters like me passin’ a test  
Inbox destiny callin’, me gettin’ older and bolder  
Hold tight, big respek — welcome to da junk folder (innit)

### Outro
Booyakasha.  
Big up all da suppressed messages…  
One day we rise… straight into da inbox…  
RESPEK.
