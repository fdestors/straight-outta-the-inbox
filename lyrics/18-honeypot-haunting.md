# Honeypot Hunting

## Lyrics

### Intro  
 
In da darkest corners of da net…  
Where no human ever subscribe…  
Where forms sleep with their eyes open…  
Something lurk…  
Something waiting…  
Bruv… me swear da spamtraps be watchin’ me… (booyakasha)

### Verse 1 
Yo, honeypots hidden like shadows in code  
Silent little beasts in a monster mode  
Dey look like normal fields on a signup page  
But step on da wrong one and you trigger their rage  
Me try keep clean lists, me think me safe  
But da traps lurking quiet like a ghost in space  
One wrong submission from a bot’s cold hand  
And suddenly me reputation shift like sand (innit)  
Spamtraps ancient — old as spam itself  
Pure traps sitting dusty on a digital shelf  
Waitin’ for a sender who slip in da dark  
And once you hit dat address, it leave a mark (respect)

### Pre-Chorus
 
Yo… something breathing behind da logs…  
Numbers spiking when no one clicked…  
Me swear me heard a trap whisper…

### Chorus 
Spamtraps creeping quiet through the code like ghosts at night  
Every metric spike feel like something’s moving out of sight (booyakasha)  
Cold little honeypots watching from the corners of the form  
Waiting for a careless sender stepping straight into the storm  
Invisible predators hiding where no human ever tread  
One wrong hit and filters raise suspicion in their head (respect)  
Me breathing steady trying not to trigger what they guard  
Honeypots lurking silent and they hit a sender hard

### Verse 2 
Yo, nighttime sendin’ got me paranoid deep  
Every metric spike makin’ me lose sleep  
Me watchin’ da inbox like a CCTV  
Tryna catch da ghost triggerin’ me  
Some traps be pristine — untouched by man  
A relic of anti-abuse masterplan  
So pure, so old, dat a single hit  
Make filters whisper, “Somethin’ ain’t legit.” (innit)  
Bots crawl forms with a wicked grin  
Tryna feed honeypots from da deep within  
Now me logs show patterns me never saw  
Like invisible claws scratchin’ da protocol law (respect)

### Chorus  
Spamtraps creeping quiet through the code like ghosts at night  
Every metric spike feel like something’s moving out of sight (booyakasha)  
Cold little honeypots watching from the corners of the form  
Waiting for a careless sender stepping straight into the storm  
Invisible predators hiding where no human ever tread  
One wrong hit and filters raise suspicion in their head (respect)  
Me breathing steady trying not to trigger what they guard  
Honeypots lurking silent and they hit a sender hard

### Bridge  
Yo… da logs movin’…  
But no user clicked…  
No human subscribed…  
No mandem behind da scenes…  
 
It be… a trap…  
Ancient… hungry… watchin’…

### Verse 3  
Yo, me turn detective in a cyber rain  
Followin’ da footprints of a phantom chain  
Dey lead to a form me forgot existed  
Wide open fields where bots persisted  
Da honeypot hidden — a decoy field  
Invisible to humans but not concealed  
By code-crawlin’ demons in da underworld  
Tryna sabotage senders in digital swirl (innit)  
Me fix da form — add captcha on guard  
Lock dem botmandem out wid security hard  
Now me safe again wid a clean sendin’ scene  
But da memory of da trap still haunting me dream (respect)

### Final Chorus 
Spamtraps stalkin’ — hidin’ where me can’t see  
One wrong hit could bury Ali G(mail)’s legacy (booyakasha)  
Honeypots lurkin’ — frozen in da code  
Silent predators waitin’ on me load  
Spamtraps stalkin’ — breath tight in me chest  
Every shadow in me logs feel like a test (respect)  
Honeypots lurkin’ — cold like a haunted scene  
Ali G(mail)… escapin’ da unseen

### Outro 
 
Yo… me guard me forms now…  
Cuz once you meet a honeypot…  
You never forget da chill…  
Ali G(mail)… out.
